"If we could climb to the top, we might find a way to break through the sky. It seems a good plan."</p><p>"That is what I was thinking," said the lynx. "It is true I don't know just where it is. But a moon's journey from here, there lives a Manito who has the shape of a giant. He knows, and he could tell us."</p></div> </div>
