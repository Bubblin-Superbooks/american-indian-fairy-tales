They did so; and O-jeeg, who stayed awake while his friends slept, noticed that only two of the Manito's eyes were closed, while the one in his forehead remained wide open.</p><p>In the morning the Manito told O-jeeg to travel straight toward the North Star, and that in twenty suns&mdash;the Indian name for days&mdash;they would reach the mountain. "As you are a Manito yourself," he said, "you may be able to climb to the top, and to take your friends with you. But I cannot promise that you will be able to get down again."</p></div> </div>
