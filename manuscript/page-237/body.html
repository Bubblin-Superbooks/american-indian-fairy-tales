One of these stories was the story of a Happy Land, a far-off place where it was always Summer; where no one wept or suffered sorrow.</p><p>It was for this land that she sighed. It filled her thoughts by day, when she sought the secret places of the hills, and sat in some lonely spot, listening to the mysterious voices that whispered in the breeze. Where was this Happy Land&mdash;this place without pain or care?</p><p>Tired out at night, she would sink into her bed. Then from their hiding places would come stealing the small messengers of Weenz, the Spirit of Sleep. These kindly gnomes&mdash;too small for the human eye to see&mdash;</p></div> </div>
