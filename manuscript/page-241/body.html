<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From your haunt in summer glade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasten to your mournful maid.</p><p>Was it only her fancy, that she seemed to hear the closing</p><p>words of her song echoed from the deep woods where the merry little men had vanished? Or was it the Puk-Wudjies mocking her?</p><p>She had lingered later than usual; it was time to go. The new moon swung low in the western sky, with its points turned upwards to the heavens. An Indian would say he could hang his powder horn upon it, and that it meant dry weather, when the leaves crackled under the hunter's feet, and the animals fled before him, so that he was unable to come near-enough to shoot. And Neen-i-zu was glad of this. In the Happy Land, she declared no one would suffer, and no life would be taken.</p></div> </div>
