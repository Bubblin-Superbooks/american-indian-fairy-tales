<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jack Rabbit had long legs, and long ears&mdash;almost as long as a mule's, and no animal of his size could jump so high. But of course he could not jump as high as Antelope&mdash;the name of a beautiful little deer, with short horns and slender legs, who could run like the wind.</p><p>Another thing that made the happy valley such a pleasant place to live in was the river that flowed through it. All the animals came from miles around to drink from its clear, cool waters, and to bathe in it on a hot summer day. One shallow pool seemed made especially for the little boy and girl. Their friend, the Beaver, with his flat tail like an oar and his feet webbed like a duck's, had taught them how to swim almost as soon as they had learned to walk; and to splash around in the pool on a warm afternoon was among their greatest pleasures.</p></div> </div>
